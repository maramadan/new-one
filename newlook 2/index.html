<h2>3.6: PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTS (PPEs) </h2>
<p>-	Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other accessories worn as a barrier against laboratory hazards. </p>
<p>-	Examples of PPE include laboratory coats or gowns, gloves, safety glasses, face shields, masks and respirators. </p>
<p>-	The appropriate use of PPE is only one of a variety of different strategies used to increase personal safety in the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	It must be recognized that the use of PPE does not eliminate the hazard nor can it compensate for poor technique or disregard for established safety practices.</p>
<p>-	However, when PPE is used correctly and as a supplement to the diligent use of good laboratory techniques and practices, it can further minimize the risk of personal exposure to hazardous materials in the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	Where there is a risk of personal exposure to hazardous materials, primary barriers such as a chemical fume hood, a biosafety cabinet, a Plexiglas splash guard or other engineering controls are used as the first level of protection.</p>
<p>-	When these primary barriers are not sufficient to prevent personal exposure, they should be supplemented with appropriate PPE. </p>
<p>-	In some situations where it is impractical to use a biosafety cabinet or other engineering controls, personal protective equipment may form the primary barrier between an individual and hazardous or infectious materials. </p>
<p>-	As with all other engineering and work practice controls the selection and use of PPE should be based upon a risk assessment of the hazards associated with the specific laboratory procedure that is being performed. </p>
<p>-	For example gloves should be worn when it can be reasonably expected that hands may come into contact with hazardous materials. </p>
<p>-	Similarly, a face shield/mask should be worn to protect the face, eyes, nose, and mouth, if a procedure that may generate a splash cannot be performed safely behind an engineered splash guard. </p>
<p>-	While protection of individuals working in the laboratory is the foremost consideration for the use of PPE, protecting experiments from contamination by the worker may also be used as justification for the use of PPE. This may include the use of PPE for invasive/surgical procedures, sensitive bioassays or PCR experiments. </p>
<p>-	Regardless of the reason for wearing PPE, it should be removed when experiments are completed and should never be worn outside the laboratory. </p>
<p>-	Finally, it should be noted that inappropriate use of PPE defeats its intended purpose and may increase risk. For example, failing to remove contaminated gloves before touching clean surfaces may expose others in the laboratory to risk; wearing a lab coat outside the laboratory may spread contamination to public areas; or using a respirator designed for use with chemical solvents will not protect the wearer from hazardous particulates. </p>

<h3>3.6.1: LABORATORY COAT:</h3>
<p>4.	Laboratory coats are available in a variety of different materials and fabrics and are principally worn to protect clothing and arms from inadvertent contamination while working in the laboratory. </p>
<p>5.	It is important to choose a coat based on the level of protection that is needed. For example a lab coat worn to protect against spilled or splashed liquids should be capable of preventing liquids from soaking through and contaminating an individual’s clothing or skin. </p>
<p>6.	If there are specific concerns about a splash to the front of the coat, a solid front gown or an apron worn in conjunction with a laboratory coat may be a more appropriate choice. </p>
<p>7.	Similarly, Many laboratory coats, particularly disposable coats made from synthetic material may offer very little protection if they come into contact with a heat source. If exposure to open flames or other heat sources is a concern, laboratory coats designated as fire resistant (FR) should be considered. </p>
<p>8.	Laboratory coats with knit or closed cuffs are preferred since they reduce the possibility of hanging cuffs coming into contact with hazardous materials and can offer more protection for the wrist and lower arm. For critical work where it is essential to prevent exposures to the lower arm, gloves can be easily pulled over the sleeve of a lab coat with a knit cuff. </p>
<p>9.	Laboratory coats should be discarded or laundered when they become soiled or contaminated. Laboratory coats that are grossly contaminated with infectious material should be disinfected immediately with either a chemical disinfectant or by autoclaving before they are laundered or disposed of as decontaminated waste. Disposable lab coats are recommended in situations where there are no departmental or laboratory facilities for laundering. Lab coats should not be taken home for laundering. </p>

<h3>3.6.2: GLOVES: </h3>
<p>1.	There is no single glove type that is suitable for all applications. Like all other PPE, gloves should be selected and used based upon the hazards and specific requirements of the procedure being performed. </p>
<p>2.	For example, delicate work requires the use of thin, flexible gloves (alternatives to latex gloves should be available); chemically resistant gloves are required when handling solvents; and thermally resistant gloves are needed when operating autoclaves or storing/retrieving materials at ultra-low temperatures. </p>
<p>3.	In addition to the general hazards that may be encountered in any laboratory, biology and microbiology laboratories may have specific hazards associated with infectious agents or other biological materials that require the use of gloves. These hazards include but are not limited to bacterial, viral or fungal pathogens classified as risk group 2/BSL-2 (or greater) or toxins derived from biological sources. </p>
<p>4.	Gloves are also specifically recommended for recombinant DNA work involving organisms from risk group 2/ BSL-2 (or greater) or DNA sequences derived from these organisms. For all other work involving recombinant DNA, gloves may be worn as a method of protecting experiments from personal and environmental contamination. </p>
<p>5.	Additionally, Blood borne Pathogen Standard requires the use of gloves when it can be reasonably expected that hands may come into contact with blood or blood products and otherwise potentially infectious material such as human cell lines. </p>
<p>6.	Gloves are not specifically required when working with Risk Group 1/BSL-1 organisms, defined as well characterized agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans and present minimal potential risk to laboratory personnel and the environment. </p>
<p>7.	However, Glove selection and use should always be based on an appropriate risk assessment. For example, gloves are required for work with these organisms if:</p>
<p>a.	The skin on the hands is broken, dry or cracked or if a rash is present; </p>
<p>b.	Hazardous materials (chemical, radioactive, etc.) are used in conjunction with the risk group 1 agent; or </p>
<p>c.	An individual has a condition that may increase their susceptibility to infection</p>
<p>8.	The following apply to the use of gloves as PPE in the laboratory: </p>
<p>a.	Select and use gloves that are appropriate for the procedure. </p>
<p>b.	Never touch your eyes, nose, mouth or your face while wearing gloves. </p>
<p>c.	To prevent the spread of contamination gloves must be removed before touching “clean” surfaces such as door knobs, computer keyboards, books, telephones/cell phones, etc. This rule applies to gloves worn to protect the user as well as gloves worn to protect the experiment. </p>
<p>d.	Do not wash or reuse disposable gloves. </p>
<p>e.	Dispose of single use gloves properly. For example, gloves that are contaminated with infectious agents or otherwise potentially infectious materials should be discarded as biological waste and autoclaved before their ultimate disposal as decontaminated medical/biological waste. Gloves contaminated with other materials (chemical, radioactive, etc.,) should also be disposed of according to the risk. </p>
<p>f.	Gloves must be changed when they become contaminated, or if they are torn, punctured or otherwise compromised. </p>
<p>g.	For critical experiments such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, gloves should be changed often to avoid cross contamination between samples. </p>
<p>h.	Gloves must be removed in a manner that prevents the unintentional transfer of hazardous or infectious material from the outside contaminated surfaces of the glove to unprotected skin or clothing </p>
<p>i.	Consider wearing two pair of gloves for particularly hazardous work as this permits removal of a contaminated outer glove with minimal risk of exposure. </p>
<p>j.	Gloves must not be worn outside the laboratory. If a hazardous material or sensitive experiment needs to be transported to another laboratory, it should be placed into a secondary container that can be safely handled without gloves. </p>
<p>k.	Gloves must be removed and hands washed when tasks are completed and before leaving the laboratory. The importance of proper gloving techniques and frequent and thorough hand washing is emphasized. Care should be taken when manipulating faucet handles to prevent contamination of cleaned hands. </p>

<h3>3.6.3: EYE AND FACE PROTECTION:</h3>
<p>1.	Eye and face protection such as safety glasses, goggles, face shield or similar PPE are worn when it can be reasonably expected that a splash or spray of infectious or other hazardous material may occur. </p>
<p>2.	Most importantly, all procedures, especially those requiring the use of hazardous materials, should be conducted in a manner that minimizes the creation of splashes, sprays or aerosols. </p>
<p>3.	These procedures may include but are not limited to pipetting, centrifuging, grinding, blending, shaking, mixing, sonicating, filtration using vacuum/pressure or opening containers of infectious or hazardous materials. </p>
<p>4.	Where there is a risk for a splash or spray, primary barriers such as a chemical fume hood, biosafety cabinet, plexiglas splash guard or other engineering controls are used as the first level of protection. When these primary barriers are not sufficient to prevent personal exposure, they should be supplemented with PPE specifically designed to protect the eyes and face. </p>
<p>5.	The following apply to the use of eye and face protection in the laboratory: </p>
<p>a.	Select eye and face protection that is appropriate to the task being performed. </p>
<p>b.	Do not put on or remove face/eye protection while wearing gloves that are potentially contaminated. </p>
<p>c.	Individuals who wear contact lenses in the laboratory should also wear eye protection. Contact lenses do not provide protection to the eyes. Foreign material splashed into the eye may become trapped under the contact lens and result in more serious injury. </p>
<p>d.	If eye protection is deemed necessary in a laboratory, then an emergency eyewash station should also be available. </p>
<p>e.	Eye and face protection must be decontaminated and cleaned before reuse or disposed of with other contaminated laboratory waste. </p>
<p>f.	When hazardous or infectious materials must be handled outside of a biosafety cabinet, or other containment device, eye and face protection must be worn if there is a possibility that the procedure may create a splash or spray of harmful material. </p>

<h3>3.6.4: MASKS AND RESPIRATORS: </h3>
<p>The following information is given as guidance for the selection masks and respirators for use in the laboratory. As with other PPE, their use in the laboratory is based upon a risk assessment of the hazards associated with the specific procedure(s) being performed. </p>

<h4>3.6.4.1: Surgical Masks </h4>
<p>1.	Surgical masks do not provide respiratory protection against harmful/infectious aerosols, smoke or chemical fumes. </p>
<p>2.	Although they may be used to protect the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose from a splash or spray of hazardous liquid. </p>
<p>3.	Other alternatives such as an engineered splash guard acting as a primary barrier or a face shield worn as PPE will provide superior protection in most situations. </p>

<h4>3.6.4.2: Respirators </h4>
<p>1.	While respirators can reduce the risk of exposure to inhalational hazards, their use should be considered only as a last resort or a temporary control measure. </p>
<p>2.	In most laboratory situations a biological safety cabinet, a chemical fume hood or a similar engineering control will offer more effective protection against exposure. </p>
<p>3.	Accordingly, engineering controls, as well as administrative and work practice controls (written policies, rules, standard operating procedures, supervision, training, etc) should be put into place before respirator use is taken into consideration. </p>
<p>4.	Consequently all requests for respirator use to control exposure to hazardous biological aerosols are reviewed on case by case basis Recommendations for respirator use will be based on a laboratory risk assessment, best available practices, current knowledge and professional judgment.</p>

<h3>3.6.5: FOOTWEAR:</h3>
<p>1.	Open-toed shoes are not permitted in the laboratory. Protective footwear such as shoe covers may be necessary to minimize contamination of the laboratory and prevent the accidental release of recombinant and biohazardous materials from a laboratory. </p>
<p>2.	If disposable shoe covers are used in the laboratory, waste containers must be available to dispose of used shoe covers.</p>
<p>3.	Shoe covers must not be reused.</p>

<h2>3.7: PIPETTING</h2>
<p>-	Pipetting is the act of transferring, measuring or dispensing a liquid through a small piece of apparatus typically consisting of a narrow tube. </p>
<p>-	Pipettes can be constructed of a variety of glass or plastic materials. </p>
<p>-	Liquids can be drawn into the pipet through the use of hand-held bulbs, manual pipette aids, motorized pipette aids, or various other vacuum sources. </p>
<p>-	Pipetting is a routine function in most laboratories; therefore, the safety concerns must not be overlooked. </p>
<p>-	The following safety rules must be followed when using pipettes:</p>
<p>-	Never pipette by mouth.</p>
<p>-	Visually inspect the pipette prior to inserting it into any pipette aid. Make sure the pipette does not have any cracks.</p>
<p>-	Always dispose of pipettes in hard walled containers.</p>
<p>-	Routinely clean and inspect pipette aids and bulbs. Damaged pipette aids and weakened bulbs must be discarded.</p>
<p>-	Motorized pipette aids should have some type of filter (typically 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm) to prevent liquid from accidentally being drawn into the housing.</p>

<h2>3.8: LABORATORY EQUIPMENTS: </h2>
<h3>3.8.1: BIOLOGICAL SAFETY CABINETS: </h3>
<p>When properly installed and certified, the biological safety cabinets (BSCs) listed in the table below may be used for work in BSL 1, BSL 2 and BSL 3 laboratories. As indicted these BSCs provide varying degrees of protection when working with infectious or toxic materials. Small or minute amounts of volatile chemicals (as indicated in the table below) may only be used if the BSC is exhausted to the outside though an in-line charcoal filter and is equipped with an explosion proof motor and electrical components. BSCs DO NOT provide the same level of protection as a chemical fume hood when working with volatile or other hazardous chemicals and should not be used as a substitute for a chemical fume hood. Similarly, a chemical fume hood will not provide adequate protection when working with infectious agents and other hazardous biological materials.</p>

<h4>3.8.1.1: Preparing for work in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Before starting work in the BSC, review all procedures that will be used; identify the necessary equipment and materials that will be needed and develop a plan for safe and efficient work. </p>
<p>2.	If the cabinet is not running, turn on the blower and fluorescent lights and turn off the UV light if it is on. </p>
<p>3.	Verify that the BSC is operating correctly: </p>
<p>1.	Check the instrument display/gauges for operational status. </p>
<p>2.	Check the intake and exhaust grills for obstructions. </p>
<p>3.	Check that the sash is in the appropriate position. </p>
<p>4.	Check for the inward flow of air at the face of the BSC by holding a tissue near the bottom edge of the sash. </p>

<p>5.	Wipe down the interior surfaces of the cabinet with an appropriate disinfectant such as 70% ethanol, WEX-CIDE, a 1:100 dilution of household bleach (0.05% sodium hypochlorite) or another suitable disinfectant. Note that bleach, although an excellent and inexpensive disinfectant, will react with stainless steel surfaces of the hood and must be followed with a rinse of sterile water or 70% ethanol. </p>
<p>6.	Load the cabinet with materials that will be needed for the procedure, wiping their surfaces with 70% ethanol to minimize the introduction of contaminants into the BSC. Position the materials near the back of the hood and organize them in a manner that will allow for the separation of clean and contaminated items during your work in the hood. Only materials needed for immediate work should be place in the cabinet. Extra supplies (gloves, culture flasks/plates should be stored outside the cabinet). </p>
<p>7.	Define a work area 4 to 5 inches behind the front grill of the hood. This area may be covered with a plastic-backed absorbent liner to minimize the effects of splatter and aerosol generation and to facilitate clean-up in the event of a spill. The liner may be moistened with an appropriate disinfectant to promote aseptic conditions within the cabinet. </p>
<p>8.	Before beginning your work, allow the hood to run for a minimum of 5 minutes to purge any airborne contaminates from the work area. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.2: Working in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). At a minimum, a lab coat with close-fitting sleeves and gloves should be worn. Because it is appropriate to wash your hands after removing gloves, double-gloving is a good option if you anticipate the need for glove changes during your work or in the event of a spill a double pair of gloves adds an additional layer of personal protection. </p>
<p>2.	Proper aseptic technique is essential. The BSC will prevent aerosol contamination but will not prevent contact transfer resulting from poor technique. </p>
<p>3.	Avoid rapid, sweeping movements of the arms into or out of the cabinet. Move items into our out of the cabinet slowly and perpendicular to the face of the cabinet to minimize disturbance to the protective curtain of air. </p>
<p>4.	Do not block the air flow in the BSC by resting you arms or placing discarded plastic wrappers, procedure notes or other materials on the grill at the front of the BSC. </p>
<p>5.	Organize your work to maintain a separation of clean materials from materials that have become contaminated during use. </p>
<p>6.	Provide a container(s) within the BSC for the collection of contaminated waste and other materials. Repeated movement out of the hood to discard pipettes or other waste materials can disrupt airflow in the cabinet and marginalize the protection to both the individual working at the BSC and to the cultures that are being manipulated. </p>
<p>1.	Low profile, horizontal containers are preferable to vertical containers as they are less obstructive to airflow in the cabinet. </p>
<p>2.	Contaminated items that will not be reused may be placed into small biohazard bag or a similar container. </p>
<p>3.	If chemical disinfection will be used for the decontamination of reusable items an appropriate disinfectant should be poured into the discard container prior to use.</p>
<p>4.	Alternatively. If contaminated materials will be sterilized by autoclaving add enough water to the discard pan to ensure that sufficient steam is generated during autoclaving. </p>
<p>7.	Do not work with open flames or other heat sources. These generate heated convection currents that may disrupt the smooth flow of air in the hood and may also damage the hood’s HEPA filters. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.2: Completion of work in the BSC </h4>
<p>1.	Discard all waste materials generated by your work into appropriate containers inside the BSC. Close or cover all open containers. </p>
<p>2.	Allow the cabinet to run for 3 to 5 minutes with no activity. </p>
<p>3.	Disinfect the surfaces of all materials, equipment and containers that will be removed from the BSC, to minimize subsequent contamination in the laboratory. </p>
<p>4.	Remove contaminated gloves and dispose of them appropriately </p>
<p>5.	After putting on a clean pair of gloves, remove all materials for the BSC. </p>
<p>6.	Wipe down all interior surfaces of the BSC with an appropriate disinfectant. </p>
<p>7.	If the BSC is not scheduled for subsequent use, turn off the fluorescent light and cabinet blower. BSCs are designed for 24 hour operation, but in the interest of energy conservation it should be shut down when it will not be used for an extended period of time. </p>
<p>8.	Turn of the UV light if the cabinet is equipped and if appropriate. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.4: Spills in a Biological Safety Cabinet </h4>
<p>9.	Leave the Biological Safety Cabinet turned on.</p>
<p>10.	During the cleanup of spills, gloves should be changed whenever they become contaminated, after the work surface is decontaminated and before placing a new absorbent liner in the cabinet. Unless working with a double pair of gloves, hands should be washed whenever gloves are changed. </p>

<p>11.	Small Spills that occur while working in the BSC should be handled immediately to avoid subsequent spread of the contaminating material. </p>
<p>1.	Protect the other materials you are working with from possible contamination by closing culture plates, flasks, bottles of media, etc. </p>
<p>2.	If the spill has been absorbed by a liner, carefully fold the liner over on itself so that further contact with spilled material is prevented by the liner’s plastic backing. Otherwise contain the spill with absorbent materials and apply and an appropriate disinfectant. </p>
<p>3.	Any splatter onto items within the cabinet, as well as the cabinet interior, should be immediately cleaned with absorbent paper toweling soaked with disinfectant. </p>
<p>4.	The materials used for cleanup should be put into a biohazard bag or wrapped in a leak-proof liner before removal from the BSC for proper disposal. </p>
<p>5.	After decontamination is complete, allow the BSC to run for 3 to 5 minutes before resuming your work. </p>

<p>6.	Large Spills that result in liquids flowing across the work surface or through the front or rear grills require more extensive decontamination. </p>
<p>1.	Contain the spill with absorbent material </p>
<p>2.	All items within the cabinet should be surface decontaminated and removed from the BSC. </p>
<p>3.	Apply an appropriate decontaminating solution onto the work surface and if necessary through the grill(s) and into the drain pan or lower plenum and allow 20 to 30 minutes contact time for decontamination; this varies with the disinfectant and the infectious agent. Consult the MSDS for the agent and/or the manufacturer’s directions for the disinfectant. </p>
<p>4.	The spilled fluid and disinfectant solution on the work surface should be absorbed with paper towels and discarded into a biohazard bag before removal from the BSC. </p>
<p>5.	If material was spilled though the cabinet’s grills, the work surface must be removed after it is decontaminated to allow access and cleaning of the drain pan or lower plenum. </p>
<p>6.	If the BSC is equipped with a drain valve, the spilled liquid and decontaminating solution may be emptied through a piece of flexible tubing attached to the drain valve and into a collection vessel containing additional disinfectant. The tubing should be of sufficient length to allow the open end to be submerged in the disinfectant within the collection vessel. For BSC’s without a drain valve, the spilled liquid and disinfectant should be absorbed with paper towels and discarded into a biohazard bag. </p>
<p>7.	Should the spilled liquid contain radioactive material, a similar procedure can be followed. </p>

<h4>3.8.1.5: Routine Maintenance of a Biological Safety Cabinet </h4>
<h4>Weekly or as needed </h4>
<p>1.	With the cabinet running verify that the reading on the pressure gauge is within the correct range for safe operation of the BSC. </p>
<p>2.	Disinfect all surfaces inside the cabinet with 70% ethanol or another appropriate disinfectant. To facilitate cleaning a tool similar to the swiffer sweeper may be used to manipulate a disposable towel saturated with 70% ethanol into the less accessible regions of the cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	The glass, front sash of the cabinet may also be cleaned with 70% ethanol or glass cleaner. </p>
<p>4.	If UV light is used in conjunction with chemical disinfectants for the disinfection of interior cabinet surfaces, the light must be cleaned at least weekly with 70% ethanol to ensure that the light’s effectiveness is not diminished by the accumulation of dust or other deposits on its surface. </p>

<h4>Monthly or as needed </h4>
<p>1.	Clean the exterior surfaces of the BSC with a damp cloth or disposable towel. Pay particular attention to remove any accumulated dust on the front and top of the cabinet </p>
<p>2.	Disinfect all surfaces inside the cabinet with 70% ethanol or another appropriate disinfectant. To facilitate cleaning a tool similar to the swiffer sweeper may be used to manipulate a disposable towel saturated with 70% ethanol into the less accessible regions of the cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	Remove the cabinet work surface for access to the lower plenum / drain pan. Dirty drain pan surfaces and grilles, may eventually block the drain valve and/or obstruct airflow in the cabinet. Apply 70% ethanol to the dirty surfaces and wipe them carefully using disposable paper towels. Use caution while wiping these surfaces to avoid injury from broken glass that may be present and sharp metal edges. Never leave toweling on the drain pan because the paper could block the drain valve or the air passages in the cabinet. </p>

<h4>Annually</h4>
<p>Have the biological safety cabinet certified by a qualified technician</p>

<h3>3.8.2: CENTRIFUGES</h3>
<p>1.	Hazards associated with centrifuging include mechanical failure (e.g. rotor failure, tube or bucket failure) and the creation of aerosols. </p>
<p>2.	To minimize the risk of mechanical failure, centrifuges must be maintained and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. </p>
<p>3.	Users must be properly trained, and operating instructions that include safety precautions must be prominently posted on the unit. </p>
<p>4.	The greatest aerosol hazard is created if a tube breaks during centrifugation. </p>
<p>5.	To minimize the generation of aerosols when centrifuging BSL-2 or BSL-3 agents the following procedures are required:</p>
<p>1.	Use sealed tubes, safety cups, or sealed rotors that seal with O-rings. </p>
<p>2.	Before use, inspect tubes, O-rings and buckets for cracks, chips, erosions, bits of broken glass, etc. </p>
<p>3.	Do not use aluminum foil to cap centrifuge tubes because it may detach or rupture during centrifugation.</p>
<p>4.	Open sealed tubes, safety cups, or sealed rotors inside a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>5.	Avoid overfilling of centrifuge tubes so that closures do not become wet. </p>
<p>6.	After tubes are filled and sealed, wipe them down with disinfectant.</p>
<p>7.	Do not decant or pour off supernatant of tubes containing biohazardous materials.</p>
<p>8.	Use a vacuum system with appropriate in-line reservoirs and filters.</p>
<p>9.	Work in a biosafety cabinet when re-suspending sedimented material from a biohazardous source. </p>
<p>10.	Use a swirling rotary motion rather than shaking.</p>
<p>11.	If shaking is necessary, wait a few minutes to permit the aerosol to settle before opening the tube.</p>
<p>12.	Small low-speed centrifuges may be placed in a biosafety cabinet during use to reduce the aerosol escape. High-speed centrifuges pose additional hazards. Precautions must be taken to filter the exhaust air from vacuum lines. Manufacturers, recommendations must be meticulously followed to avoid metal fatigue, distortion and corrosion.</p>
<p>13.	Avoid the use of celluloid (cellulose nitrate) tubes with biohazardous materials. Celluloid centrifuge tubes are highly flammable and prone to shrinkage with age. They distort on boiling and can be highly explosive in an autoclave. If celluloid tubes must be used, an appropriate chemical disinfectant must be used to decontaminate them.</p>

<h3>3.8.3: AEROSOL-GENERATING EQUIPMENT</h3>
<p>1.	The use of blenders, ultrasonic disrupters, grinders and lyophilizers can result in considerable aerosol production. </p>
<p>2.	This equipment and any other device that may generate an aerosol must be used in a biosafety cabinet when working at BSL-2 or BSL-3.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.1: Blenders</h4>
<p>1.	Safety blenders are designed to prevent leakage from the bottom of the blender jar, provide a cooling jacket to avoid biological inactivation and to withstand sterilization by autoclaving.</p>
<p>2.	Test blender rotors with sterile saline or dye solution to determine if they are leak-proof prior to use with recombinant and/or biohazardous material. </p>
<p>3.	The use of glass blender jars is not recommended because of the breakage potential. If they must be used, glass jars must be covered with a polypropylene jar to prevent spraying of glass and contents in the event the blender jar breaks. </p>
<p>4.	A towel moistened with disinfectant must be placed over the top of the blender during use. </p>
<p>5.	Before opening the blender jar, allow the unit to rest for at least one minute to allow the aerosol to settle and then open in a BSC. </p>
<p>6.	The device must be decontaminated promptly after use.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.2: Sonicators and French Presses</h4>
<p>1.	Sonication of living microorganisms is potentially a source of aerosols. Whether using sonicating bath or probe sonicator, precautions must be taken to protect personnel.</p>
<p>2.	Ordinarily, this will be done by performing the sonication in a biosafety cabinet or glove box.</p>
<p>3.	It is prudent to consider all surfaces in the vicinity of the sonicator to be contaminated following its use, and they must be thoroughly disinfected.</p>
<p>4.	The use of French pressure cells requires similar caution. </p>
<p>5.	The greatest potential for aerosols is at or near the end of a pressing cycle, when air bubbles at the top of the column of suspension can escape with little or no warning. This can result in microaerosols, which will contaminate the work area, but also in macroaerosols which can effectively inoculate the mucus membranes and conjunctivae of the operator. </p>
<p>6.	Due to the size of the press, it is usually impractical to perform this operation inside a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>7.	Thus, one must avoid pressing live organisms which are human pathogens. </p>
<p>8.	Operators must use face shields or other eye protection.</p>
<p>9.	Arcing, which sometimes occurs during electroporation of bacteria, can also cause aerosols. </p>
<p>10.	These range from minimal spattering of the bacteria/DNA solution to major broadcast of potentially infectious material when a cuvette shatters. The shields supplied with most electroporators are usually sufficient to protect the operator from flying plastic and gross contamination, but will not contain microaerosols. </p>
<p>11.	Thus, if one must electroporate bacteria at BSL-2 or 3, it must be done in a biosafety cabinet.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.3: Cell Concentrators</h4>
<p>1.	Cell concentrators are also employed in laboratories as a means of handling viable organisms.</p>
<p>2.	There are two principal types of cell concentrators. </p>
<p>3.	The first involves the removal (through evaporation) of liquid from solid material thereby increasing the concentration versus volume.</p>
<p>4.	The second involves the retention of the solid material on the surface of a filter and the subsequent harvesting of the material from the filter surface. </p>
<p>5.	The following safety rules must be applied when using such an apparatus:</p>
<p>6.	Before starting, check all of the equipment to be used for signs of stress or fatigue. Pay close attention to tubing and glassware</p>
<p>7.	When possible conduct the procedure in a biosafety cabinet.</p>
<p>8.	Upon the completion of the run, thoroughly sanitize the apparatus before the next experiment.</p>
<p>9.	For rotary type concentrators, make sure the load is balanced.</p>
<p>10.	If a vacuum is to be used, make sure the appropriate exhaust filter is present on the vacuum line to prevent contamination (normally a 0.22μm hydrophobic filter).</p>
<p>11.	Do not exceed recommended pressures or speed for operation of equipment.</p>

<h4>3.8.3.4: Lyophilizers and Ampoules</h4>
<p>1.	Depending on lyophilizer design, aerosol production may occur when material is loaded or removed from the lyophilizer unit. </p>
<p>2.	If working at BSL-2 or BSL-3, sample material must be loaded in a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>3.	The vacuum pump exhaust must be filtered to remove any hazardous agents or, alternatively, the pump can be vented into a biosafety cabinet. </p>
<p>4.	After lyophilization is completed, all surfaces of the unit that have been exposed to the agent must be disinfected.</p>
<p>5.	If the lyophilizer is equipped with a removable chamber, it must be closed off and moved to a biosafety cabinet for unloading and decontamination. </p>
<p>6.	Handling of cultures must be minimized and vapor traps must be used.</p>
<p>7.	Opening ampoules containing liquid or lyophilized culture material at BSL-2 and BSL-3 must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to control the aerosol produced. </p>
<p>8.	To open, nick the neck of the ampoule with a file. Wrap it in a disinfectant soaked towel. Hold the ampoule upright and snap it open at the nick. </p>
<p>9.	Reconstitute the contents of the ampoule by slowly adding liquid to avoid aerosolization of the dried material. Mix the contents without bubbling and withdraw it into a resh container. </p>
<p>10.	Discard the towel and ampoule top and bottom as biohazardous material waste.</p>
<p>11.	Ampoules used to store biohazardous material in liquid nitrogen have exploded causing eye injuries. </p>
<p>12.	The use of polypropylene tubes eliminates this hazard. These tubes are available dust-free and presterilized, and are fitted with polyethylene caps with silicone washers. </p>
<p>13.	Heat sealable polypropylene tubes are also available.</p>

<h4>3.8.4: PROTECTING VACUUM SYSTEMS</h4>
<p>1.	The aspiration of tissue culture media from cultures and supernatants from centrifuged samples into primary collection flasks is a common laboratory procedure. Protection against pulling biological aerosols or overflow fluid into the vacuum system is necessary.</p>
<p>2.	An overflow flask and a cartridge type filter are required to provide protection for the vacuum line.</p>
<p>3.	For assembling the apparatus, flexible tubing is used of appropriate inside diameter for the flask and filter fittings and of sufficient wall thickness for the applied vacuum. Filter flask of capacities from 250 to 4,000 ml may be used for the overflow flask depending on the amount of fluid that could be aspirated out of the collection flask.</p>
<p>4.	The overflow flask contains a disinfectant solution appropriate for the recombinant and/or biological material in use. Bubbling of air through the disinfectant can cause foam which can shut off the vacuum if it reaches the filter.</p>
<p>5.	Change the filter if it becomes contaminated.</p>

<h2>3.9: DECONTAMINATION:</h2>
<p>1.	Decontamination is a process in which a laboratory worker cleans an area, equipment, device, or material so it is safe to work in/on or handle. </p>
<p>2.	The main purpose of decontaminating is to reduce the level of microbial contamination so that infection transmission is eliminated. </p>
<p>3.	Decontamination process include:  </p>
<p>1.	Hand washing their hands with soap and water.</p>
<p>2.	Autoclaving biohazardous waste.</p>
<p>3.	Liquid chemical germicides disinfectants may be used for decontamination of laboratory surfaces such as bench tops. </p>
<p>4.	The most common disinfectants that are used for decontamination are sodium hypochlorite solutions, oxidative solutions, peracetic acid, phenols, and iodophors. </p>
<p>5.	Disinfectants chosen must be effective against agents that are being used in the laboratory. </p>
<p>6.	Individuals should refer to the agent’s Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), if available, to determine the type of disinfectant to use. A source of microbial MSDS is “Material</p>
<p>7.	Concentration and contact time can vary depending on the formulation and the manufacturer’s instructions for use.</p>
<p>8.	SAEC requires laboratories to have a decontamination procedure in place and available in the laboratory prior to work: </p>
<p>1.	A decontamination procedure should describe what disinfectant will be used, the concentration level, and the contact time needed to disinfect. </p>
<p>2.	It should also include the rationale for the disinfecting agent, the approach to its application, and other parameters.</p>

<h2>3.10: STORAGE OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIALS</h2>
<p>1.	A biological hazard sign must be clearly posted on storage areas such as refrigerators, freezers, cabinets, etc. containing recombinant and/or biohazardous materials.</p>
<p>2.	All containers and/or racks are to be clearly labeled to identify the contents.</p>
<p>3.	Storage containers must be intact (no tears or cracks), leak-proof and covered or closed to avoid spills or contamination. Secondary containment must be used when possible.</p>
<p>4.	To prevent unnecessary handling of specimens, all materials should be inventoried and organized.</p>
<p>5.	Any substance being stored in a freezer must be placed in a labeled container designed for low temperature storage.</p>
<p>6.	If flammable materials are used, they must be stored in equipment that is designed for this purpose.</p>
<p>7.	No personal items must be stored in lab refrigerators, freezers or incubators (e.g. food, beverages).</p>
<p>8.	When storage equipment needs repair, calibration or transport, it must be completely decontaminated prior to starting work or being removed.</p>

<h2>3.11: DISPOSAL OF BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL WASTE </h2>
<p>1.	Each laboratory is responsible for the proper collection and disposal of biological and medical waste. </p>
<p>2.	The regulated materials as well as any items contaminated by contact with these materials should be separated from the regular waste stream and collected in appropriate containers. </p>
<p>3.	Regulated Materials include: </p>
<p>1.	Cultures and stocks of infectious agents and associated biological, including laboratory waste, biological production wastes, discarded live and attenuated vaccines, culture dishes, and related devices. </p>
<p>2.	Liquid human and animal waste, including blood and blood products and body fluids, but not including urine or materials stained with blood or body fluids. </p>
<p>3.	Pathological waste such as human organs, tissues, body parts other than teeth, products of conception, and fluids removed by trauma or during surgery or autopsy or other medical procedure, and not fixed in formaldehyde. </p>
<p>4.	Sharps including needles, syringes, scalpels, and intravenous tubing with needles attached. </p>
<p>5.	Contaminated wastes from research animals that have been exposed to agents infectious to humans. </p>
<p>6.	Proper disposal of these regulated materials is detailed below. </p>

<h3>3.11.1: Solid Waste </h3>
<p>1.	Solid waste including culture plates, flasks and other disposable materials containing or contaminated with regulated waste materials such gloves, or materials used for cleaning/absorbing spills of blood or other biological liquids shall be collected in a durable leak proof container. </p>
<p>2.	This container shall be prominently labeled for biohazardous waste collection and equipped with a lid to minimize exposure to discarded waste material. </p>
<p>3.	A five gallon biohazard disposal bucket available from a variety of vendors is recommended. </p>
<p>4.	The carrying handle and smaller size of the 5 gallon bucket allow for easy and safe transport of biological waste from the laboratory to an autoclave for decontamination. </p>
<p>5.	Containers for collection of solid biological and medical waste should be lined with a clear, autoclavable, polypropylene bag. </p>
<p>6.	Do not collect regulated waste in bags that are printed with the biohazard symbol and/or labeled for biohazardous waste. </p>
<p>7.	Even after decontamination in an autoclave, these bags will not be accepted for final disposal in local sanitary landfills and will consequently require additional expense for disposal. </p>
<p>8.	Do not overfill or compact waste in the container. When the container is approximately 3/4 full, loosely gather the top of the autoclavable liner into the bucket/container and close the lid for safe transport to an autoclave. </p>
<p>9.	At the autoclave, remove the bag from the bucket and place into an autoclavable secondary container. </p>
<p>10.	Add about 250ml of water to the bag. This will facilitate the generation of steam within the bag necessary for decontamination of the waste. Before loading into the autoclave, place a chemical sterilization indicator into the bag so that it is located near the middle of the load, and then loosely secure the top of the bag with autoclave tape. </p>
<p>11.	Do Not seal the bag. For effective sterilization to occur it is critical that air and steam are able to move freely into and out of the bag during the autoclave cycle. </p>
<p>12.	Depending on the size of the autoclave, multiple bags of waste may be decontaminated in a single autoclave run. </p>
<p>13.	However, do not overload the autoclave since decontamination is dependent upon the size of the load. If in doubt a smaller load is better. </p>
<p>14.	Typically, biological waste should be processed for a minimum of 60 minutes.</p>
<p>15.	After autoclaving, remove the chemical indicator from the bag and verify that conditions during the run were adequate for sterilization. </p>
<p>16.	Adequately processed waste may be discarded into the regular waste stream as non-hazardous waste. </p>

<h3>3.11.2: Liquid waste </h3>
<p>1.	Blood and other body fluids may be disposed off without prior disinfection by pouring down the drain of an appropriate laboratory sink and into the sanitary sewer (A sink that is not used for hand-washing is preferred). </p>
<p>2.	Use a sufficient amount of water to rinse all the material into the drain.</p>
<p>3.	Following disposal, decontaminate the surfaces of the sink with an appropriate disinfectant such as a 10% solution of bleach and finally rinse with water to remove any residue. </p>
<p>4.	Other liquid biological wastes generated in the laboratory such as spent culture media must be decontaminated either by chemical treatment or autoclaving prior to being discarded into the sanitary sewer. </p>
<p>1.	Chemical treatment is recommended since it allows for treatment of waste in the laboratory and thereby reduces the potential for spills or exposures during transport to the autoclave. </p>
<p>2.	For chemical decontamination of liquid biological waste using bleach: add household bleach (~5% sodium hypochlorite) to the container of liquid waste so that the final volume of the solution is 10% bleach. Mix gently and allow a minimum of 30 minutes contact time before discarding into the sanitary sewer. Longer contact times may be required for some infectious agents. Contact the Biosafety Officer for additional information.</p>
<p>5.	Do not autoclave liquid wastes that have been treated with bleach. Bleach is very corrosive to the interior surfaces of an autoclave and reduces the useful life span of the autoclave and will void manufacturers’ warranties. </p>
<p>6.	For decontamination of liquid biological waste in the autoclave: </p>
<p>1.	Verify that the container holding the liquid is able to withstand autoclave temperatures and is of adequate size to minimize the potential for boil-over in the autoclave. The container should be filled to no more than about 1/3 of its capacity. </p>
<p>2.	Cover the container loosely with a lid or piece of aluminum foil, place it into an autoclavable secondary container and use a cart to transport the waste to an autoclave. </p>
<p>3.	Autoclaves the liquid biological waste using the liquid cycle/slow exhaust for a minimum of 60 minutes. A chemical indicator such as sterilization monitor should be suspended in the liquid to verify that it has reached sterilization temperatures during the run. </p>
<p>4.	Upon completion of the run, examine the chemical indicator to ensure that decontamination was successful before discarding the solution into the sanitary sewer. </p>

<h3>3.11.3: Pathological Waste </h3>
<p>1.	Human pathological waste as defined by SAEC and similar waste generated from research with animals shall be handled in the same manner. </p>
<p>2.	Items for disposal shall be contained in a sealed plastic bag and clearly labeled as pathological waste. </p>
<p>3.	Pathological waste may be stored temporarily in the laboratory’s refrigerator or freezer until arrangements can be made for proper disposal. </p>

<h3>3.11.4: Sharps </h3>
<p>1.	According to this SAEC Waste Policy, “Sharps means needles, syringes, scalpels, and intravenous tubing with needles attached.” </p>
<p>2.	For purposes of collection and disposal at SAEC, the definition of sharps may be expanded to include glass microscope slides, Pasteur pipettes, microtome blades, capillary tubes and any other items that are contaminated with infectious or potentially infectious biological materials and are capable of causing puncture wounds or lacerations if handled improperly. </p>
<p>3.	This working definition of sharps is not limited to those items that are specifically used in medical or biological procedures and with the exception sharps that are contaminated with hazardous, toxic or radioactive chemicals, includes sharps generated from all other uses. </p>
<p>4.	Guidelines for the disposal of sharps: </p>
<p>1.	Never discard needles or other disposable sharp instruments into the regular trash or into bags containing hazardous waste. </p>
<p>2.	Immediately discard all used sharps directly into puncture-resistant containers that are specifically designed / designated for the collection of sharps. </p>
<p>3.	Medical waste regulations require that containers holding discarded needles, syringes and/or scalpels are disposed of within 90 days of initial use. Selection of container size should be based upon the anticipated volume of sharps that will be generated during a 90 day period. Containers for sharps disposal can be purchased from a variety of vendors. </p>
<p>4.	Sharps containers used for the collection of needles, syringes and/or scalpels shall be dated when they are put into use and shall not be kept in the laboratory beyond 90 days from their initial use. </p>
<p>5.	Pasteur pipettes and other disposable glass items that are not contaminated with potentially infectious materials may be discarded into broken glass containers. </p>
<p>6.	Disposable syringes with needles shall be discarded as a unit. If the needle must be removed, use the integrated device for needle removal found on most sharps containers or use other mechanical means. </p>
<p>7.	Used needles and other contaminated sharps shall not be bent, broken, cut, recapped, re-sheathed or otherwise manipulated by hand. If any of the actions described above are required by a specific procedure, they will be done using a mechanical device such as pliers or hemostats. </p>
<p>8.	Do not over-fill sharps containers. They should be closed and sealed when they are approximately 3/4 full. </p>
<p>9.	If the outside of a filled sharps container is contaminated, the surface of the container should be chemically disinfected or the container autoclaved prior to being removed from the laboratory. </p>
<p>10.	Sharps containers used for the collection of discarded needles, syringes and scalpels cannot be put into the trash. Even after decontamination, these sharps are considered as regulated medical waste and must be disposed of in accordance with regulations. </p>
<p>11.	The final disposal of sharps containers is coordinated by SAEC. Filled sharps containers will be collected at a central location within the department/building. Pick-up for final disposal will be on a quarterly basis to coincide with the state mandated 90 day limit for the storage of used sharps. </p>

<h2>3.14: ANIMAL HANDLING </h2>
<p>1.	All employees who work with live animals are required to complete the IBC Placement Health Review for Animal Handlers. </p>

<h3>3.14.1: Personnel Training: </h3>
<p>1.	Animal Handlers should have Training Sessions on animal care and use.</p>
<p>2.	Required sessions are available online. These trainings provide detailed instruction on both regulatory compliance and basic husbandry. </p>
<p>3.	Husbandry (DLAR website): </p>
<p>1.	Animals shall be provided nutritionally adequate food, potable, non-contaminated water and a sanitary environment in which the animal’s health shall not be affected. </p>
<p>5.	Injections: </p>
<p>1.	All sharps shall be disposed of immediately after use in an approved sharps container. Needles shall not be broken, bent, or recapped before disposal. A one-handed recapping procedure may be incorporated only after approval by the BSO. Physical restraint procedures should be developed and practiced to prevent accidental autoinoculation while at the same time reducing stress on the animal. </p>

<p>38.	Animal Restraint: </p>
<p>39.	Proper restraint and handling techniques are essential for reducing stress to laboratory animals, while at the same time allow animal care workers to perform their work with less chance of being scratched, bitten, kicked, etc. Animals can be restrained either manually or with restraint devices. It is the responsibility of the PI to train their staff on proper restraint for each species used. </p>
<p>40.	Changing Bedding: </p>
<p>41.	Precautions should be taken, while changing animal bedding, to minimize or eliminate the aerosolization of hazardous agents which may have been shed by the animal. </p>
<p>42.	The use of a biological safety cabinet (BSC) or chemical fume hood should be used when changing animals dosed with hazardous agents. </p>
<p>43.	Many allergens can also be aerosolized during bedding changing. Some options include the use of a cage changing station, or decontaminating the soiled bedding before disposal by placing the whole cage in a biohazard bag and then autoclaving it. </p>
<p>44.	Cage changing stations are not appropriate for animals dosed with biohazardous material and autoclaving may not be appropriate for those dosed with chemical toxins. </p>

<p>45.	Allergens: </p>
<p>46.	Laboratory animal allergies and associated asthma are among the most common conditions affecting individuals who work with laboratory animals. </p>
<p>47.	Typically, allergies to animals result from repeated exposure to an animal’s dander, urine, saliva, serum, or other body tissues. Symptoms can range from mild (e.g. itchy or runny nose and eyes) to severe (e.g. shortness of breath or red, itchy wheals on skin). </p>
<p>48.	Levels of airborne allergens tend to rise significantly with certain activities such as changing or cleaning animal cages. To reduce the levels of airborne allergens, SAEC-BSI recommends using: </p>
<p>49.	Ventilated hoods (cage changing station, biological safety cabinet (BSC), or chemical fume hood) for cage changing </p>
<p>50.	Dust-free bedding, or </p>
<p>51.	Filtered caging systems. </p>
<p>52.	If these options aren’t available or feasible for a particular situation, then personal respiratory protection may be required. </p>
<p>53.	Contact BSO for more information about respirators. </p>
<p>54.	Contact BSO if you have allergy concerns. </p>

<h3>55.	Carcass Disposal: </h3>
<p>56.	All non-radioactive animal carcasses are to be collected incinerated. </p>
<p>57.	Radioactive carcasses and their associated lab waste (i.e. bedding, excreta, sharps, etc.) </p>
<p>58.	Should be bagged and sealed in 3 mil plastic bags. </p>
<p>59.	Make sure that all sharps are contained in a puncture resistant container before placing in plastic bags. </p>
<p>60.	Once properly labeled, the bags are refrigerated in a lined 30 gallon plastic drum. </p>

<h3>61.	Safe Use of Anesthetic Gases: </h3>
<p>62.	Many anesthetic gases are used at SAEC for performing animal surgeries.</p>
<p>63.	These gases can present a risk for potential exposure to the lab personnel performing the surgeries. </p>
<p>64.	Anesthetics of concern include ether, nitrous oxide, and halogenated agents (e.g. halothane, isoflurane, methoxyflurane). </p>
<p>65.	Some of these halogenated anesthetics have been linked to adverse health effects in exposed workers, such as reproductive and neurological effects.</p>
<p>66.	Emphasis must be placed on protecting personnel from exposure by adequately “capturing” the waste gas being generated. </p>
<p>67.	This may be accomplished by several methods depending on the method of delivery of the gas: </p>
<p>68.	For enclosed chambers (e.g. Bell jar): </p>
<p>69.	Perform work in a fume hood so when lid is removed, gases are captured by hood. </p>
<p>70.	Evacuate chamber via building vacuum system prior to removing lid.</p>
<p>71.	Make sure the chamber lid is tight-fitting. </p>
<p>72.	Remove chamber lid only when animal is being placed into or removed. </p>

<h3>73.	For anesthetic gas machines and vaporizers: </h3>
<p>74.	Verify that proper filtration canisters are installed. </p>
<p>75.	Maintain filter canisters according to manufacturer’s specifications. </p>
<p>76.	Choose an appropriate sized face-piece to ensure most efficient waste gas recovery. </p>
<p>77.	Maintain anesthesia machines and vaporizers according to manufacturer’s instructions and in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Program’s Policy on General Inhalational Anesthesia Machine/Vaporizer/Waste Gas Maintenance and Calibration. </p>
<p>78.	Lab personnel who are concerned with possible exposure to anesthetic gases may contact BSO to request an exposure risk evaluation.</p>

<h2>3.15: SELECT AGENTS AND TOXINS AND BIOTERRORISM </h2>
<p>1.	As a core value and moral precept of Sudanese People not to prejudice Human Integrity anywhere, SAEC and The Government of Sudan buildup and follow extremely strict, transparent and internationally cooperative policy in regard with Select Agents and Toxins and Bioterrorism. </p>
<p>2.	Globally, United States Government represented in The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and The Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) requires institutions that possess, use, or transfer certain biological agents and toxins (known as “select agents”) to be registered and approved. Listed in Appendix D.</p>
<p>3.	These select agents have been have identified as specific biological agents and toxins considered to be a severe threat to public health and safety because of their potential use as bioterrorism agents.</p>

<h3>3.15.1: Procedure: </h3>
<p>1.	SAEC institutions do not deal or handle and do not allow dealing and handling any of select agent or toxin.</p>
<p>2.	In case of one of the principal investigator has to deal or handle a select agent or toxin, following procedure should be followed:</p>

<h3>3.	Responsible Official:</h3>
<p>1.	Select agent regulations require that a Responsible Official (RO) be designated for each institution that possesses and uses select agents. </p>
<p>2.	SAEC’s RO is represented by BSO.</p>
<p>3.	RO has institutional responsibility for the biosafety, security, and regulatory compliance of select agents, and as such, must be contacted prior to obtaining any select agents.</p>
<p>4.	Authorization to Possess and Use Select Agents</p>
<p>5.	Prior to personnel obtaining any select agent, the IBC must review and approve any proposed work. </p>
<p>6.	In addition, PIs who want to acquire, possess, or use any biological agent or toxin listed as a select agent must be registered and approved with the appropriate national agency (such as Sudan National Biosefty Authority or Federal Ministry of Health) prior to obtaining the agent(s) or toxin(s).</p>
<p>7.	The appropriate agency must approve both the institution and the individual laboratory. </p>
<p>8.	Investigators who want to possess and use select agents must contact the RO for assistance with the registration process. </p>
<p>9.	Approval can take several months, and PIs should plan research projects accordingly.</p>
<p>10.	The select agent regulations contain very strict requirements regarding biosafety, training, emergency response, security and accountability, as well as other requirements. </p>
<p>11.	Investigators wanting to acquire select agents should thoroughly review the National (not yet developed) and International (such as SSH or USAD) select agent regulations (whichever is appropriate) before initiating the registration application process.</p>
